# Phase 3 Project
## Classification Modelling-Project
### Introduction
In this project, i will be doing a complete machine learning workflow with classification regression, including data preparation, modeling (including hyperparameter tuning), and final model evaluation.
### Objectives
- identifying and applying appropriate preprocessing steps
- Perform an iterative modeling process, starting from a baseline model
-  Perform model validation
- Choose a final model and evaluating its performance

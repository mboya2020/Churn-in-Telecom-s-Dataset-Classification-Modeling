# Classification Modelling with Churn in Telecom's Dataset
## Overview
###I will be running a multiple linear regression analysis on the Kings County House Sales. The dataset contains 2197 houses, includes attributes of those houses as well as their prices.Our target for this data is price and other variables are predictors. I will be preparing the dataset for modelling by preprocessing the numeric and categorical attributes in this dataset,then build a model that will ultimately yield parameters.I will also report the findings of my final model, including both predictive model performance metrics and interpretation of fitted model parameters

### I will be solving a classification problem with the Churn Telecom's Dataset. The dataset consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label(target) specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.The task is to build a classifier that predicts whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. 
The task is to predict the Churn based on the available cartographic variables:

### Business and Data Understanding
The dataset containscontains 3333 rows (customers) and 20 columns (features). Each row represents a customer, each column contains customerâ€™s attributes described on the column Metadata.

### Introduction
In this project, i will be doing a complete machine learning workflow with classification regression, including data preparation, modeling (including hyperparameter tuning), and final model evaluation.
### Objectives
- identifying and applying appropriate preprocessing steps
- Perform an iterative modeling process, starting from a baseline model
-  Perform model validation
- Choose a final model and evaluating its performance
